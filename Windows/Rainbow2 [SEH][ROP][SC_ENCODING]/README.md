# Rainbow2 POC

As found on [Github](https://github.com/xct/vulnbins) and inspired by [Vulndev](https://vulndev.io/2022/06/12/bypassing-dep-with-writeprocessmemory/).

Uses:
  * ROP shellcode encoder and decoder
  * Shellcode visualisation of bad and encoded characters
  * Bad character detection before sending buffer

Notes:
  * Only able to continue exception in debugger (SEH improvements)
  * Too big payload and/or bad shellcode characters overruns the first SEH/stackpivot
